ðŸš— Car Black Box System | Embedded Systems Project

Developed a microcontroller-based Car Black Box using the PIC18F4580 microcontroller and MPLAB IDE for firmware development. The system captures and logs critical vehicle information such as real-time speed, 
event occurrence, and timestamp data. It features a dynamic dashboard display, a menu-driven user interface (allowing users to view, clear, and download logs), and external EEPROM memory management with a circular 
buffer approach for efficient storage. Integrated a Real-Time Clock (RTC) for accurate timekeeping and UART communication for exporting logs to external systems.

Key Implementations:

1.Dashboard displaying real-time speed and time
2.Event logging mechanism capturing speed and timestamp during events
3.Menu-based navigation using a matrix keypad
4.External EEPROM-based log storage and management
5.UART-based data download functionality
6.Manual time setting and RTC synchronization
7.Embedded development using PIC18F4580 and MPLAB IDE

Project Outcomes:

1.Created a reliable system for vehicle monitoring and accident investigation
2.Strengthened skills in embedded C programming, microcontroller interfacing, memory management, and real-time systems
3.Gained practical experience in embedded communication protocols (I2C, UART)
4.Developed a complete end-to-end embedded solution similar to commercial vehicle black box systems
